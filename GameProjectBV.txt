Modified Chinese Checkers

Game Play:
Marbles can either move one spot diagonally to a vacant spot or jump over another marble. If you start jumping, you can keep taking turns until you can’t/don’t want to jump anymore.

Objective of the Game:
Move all marbles into the other player’s triangle

Modification ideas:
Invisible “potholes” transport your marble back to your starting triangle, and sneakily and unpredictably change places
